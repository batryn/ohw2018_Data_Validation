Project:  Validation of mooring instrument data with CTD cast and water sampling data

Data and datasets
Surface Mooring Instruments – pull from OOI Data Portal (M2M?)
Look at both telemetered and recovered data
•	CTDBP, CTDMO
•	DOSTA
•	FLORT
•	PHSEN
•	PCO2W
•	NUTNR

Flanking Mooring Instrumets – pull from OOI Data Portal (M2M?)\
Look at both telemetered and recovered data
•	CTDMO
•	DOSTA
•	FLORT
•	PHSEN

Shipboard CTD Rosette Measurements – download from Alfresco (by cast)
•	Temperature
•	Salinity (Conductivity)
•	Dissolved oxygen
•	Fluorometer

Water Sampling – download from Alfresco (by type)
•	Salts
•	Oxygen
•	Chlorophyll
•	pH
•	DIC/TA
•	Nutrients

Issues/Actions
•	Plot validation for Irminger 2 deployment, and Irminger 3 recovery
•	Instrument burst sampling should be averaged to one data point
•	CTD rosette data needs to be parsed out to different measurements
•	Water sampling data needs to be put into a common format
•	Need to determine timing for plotting

Challenges
•	DOSTA data may be off if foil was not sufficiently wetted
•	PHSEN/PCO2W may not be running at the time of the CTD cast
•	Needs to be modular to be able to run bits and pieces at different times with what is available
•	Shipboard CTD data may be in different formats from different ships

Steps
•	Determine time periods and OOI data sets (based on CTD cast timing for both deployed and recovered CTD casts)


For each instrument/measurement type:
•	Download telemetered data from OOI Data Portal (M2M)
•	Download recovered data from OOI Data Portal (M2M)
•	Download CTD cast files
•	Download Water Sampling results files

•	Process OOI data 
  –	Average burst data
  –	
•	Put Water Sampling data into a common format
•	Ensure all datasets are in a common output format (units)

•	Plot all data on one plot
